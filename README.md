MNIST CNN Training and Visualization
This repository contains Python code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The CNN architecture consists of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and two fully connected layers. The code includes training and evaluation loops, as well as visualization of training and test loss/accuracy over epochs.

Features:
MNIST Dataset: Utilizes the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
Simple CNN Model: Implements a simple CNN architecture for classification.
Training and Evaluation: Includes training and evaluation loops with batch processing.
Loss and Accuracy Visualization: Visualizes training and test loss/accuracy over epochs.
Confusion Matrix: Generates a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
tqdm
matplotlib
seaborn
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the main.py script to train the CNN model and visualize the training progress.
View the generated plots for training and test loss/accuracy.
Evaluate model performance using the confusion matrix.# MNIST-CNN-Training-Visualization
